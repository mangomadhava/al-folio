An interpolation software used machine learning methods such as SVM, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Lasso, etc. to compare results. Instead of manually tuning parameters such as the kernel for the SVM, or the value of K for KNN, I implemented a feature to use bayesian optimization in matlab to tune for the most optimal parameters.
