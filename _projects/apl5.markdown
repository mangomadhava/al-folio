<a href="https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/"> Dragonfly </a> is a Nasa Mission that will put a drone on the largest moon of Saturn, Titan, in the 2030's. It is set for launch in 2027, and will investigate the atmosphere and geology of <a href="https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/Why-Titan/"> Titan</a>. Being millions of miles from Earth, it requires autonomous flight based on its camera and sensors.

Dragonfly's terrain relative navigation team uses fast fourier transforms and other methods to match features between subsequent images to accurately determine position and velocity. I analyzed the algorithm for errors that could occur due to camera and sensor miscalibration, which could occur due to the harsh conditions during liftoff and while on Titan. I designed a study to test for possible miscalibration that could occur and delivered results that helped guide the development for the final version of their algorithm to accurately navigate the drone on Titan.


I also helped compare the current algorithm being developed to other state of the art feature detection algorithms.
