I am a student at the University of Maryland College Park studying computer science. During the school year, I do research through the university at NASA Harvest and the past two summers I have interned at John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.

I also play the mridangam, a south Indian percussion instrument for programs in the DC area. I also like to eat mangoesðŸ¥­, make puzzles, and look at clouds.
